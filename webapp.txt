For a web app there should be a default page where it should list open food trucks at the time when page is loaded and
it should be refreshed periodically(hourly). We should request the get the location from browser and sort the listings by nearest location 
to the user. It should have a search by which user is able to search by the kind of food or business name.it should also have an option to
see the trucks currently available on a map with location markers on which user is able to click and get more details. Web app should 
allow user to store his favourite trucks and their availability on all locations
